          <h3>That comes from the framework... or was it vanilla Javascript?</h3>
          <p>
            Having begun my journey at BLOC earlier this year, there are still times in which I get the things
            we're covering a little confused or mixed-up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sure, I struggle with retaining <em>everything</em> that I am learning. When it comes time to 
            see if I truly grasped the topics at hand, it can be concerning when I go over some of the material
            again and I feel like I'm seeing it for the first time again. While that is an
            exaggertaion, there is some truth to it. An interesting thing that can sometimes happen, is
            I will attempt to use a library-specific function inside an application and to seemingly no end, I 
            will not be able to figure out why it isn't working! What I realize is that I sometimes blue the
            lines of where vanilla Javascript ends and a framework, or library like jQuery begin. This can lead
            to frustrating evenings reading through documentation when the answer is right under my nose.
          </p>
          <p>
            This however is related to my biggest problem. I have had some experience developing with HTML, CSS and
            Javascript before I decided to take my career to the next level with BLOC. This, admittadly, has
            fostered some habits that make for poor interviewing techniques. Of course I am referring to the
            coding white board challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even after working through the BLOC curriculum, I often find myself error checking code as I write it,
            or even better, partially writing functions with console output tests to see if I'm my thought process
            is heading in the right direction. As you can probably see, this a problem as I cannot do this during
            a white board challenge!
          </p>
          <p>
            Being able to compose code in front of someone watching you, and only being able to run through it
            mentally is something completely foreign to me. During my examinations, it is by far and away the
            segments that I struggle with the most.

          <h3>THE TAKE AWAY</h3>
          <p>
            At the moment, I am practicing working through katas over at Code Wars. While this has been a 
            good way for me to practice solving specific challenges, I still find myself relying on running
            code on JSBin, especially alongside the more challenging kata.
          </p>
          <p>
            There have also been some books recommmended to me. I will followup on these and see if they help
            in addition to the online practice I'm working through.
