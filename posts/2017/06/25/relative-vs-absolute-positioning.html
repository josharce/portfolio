          <h3>Looking back at Relative vs Absolute Positioning</h3>
          <p>
            As part of the curriculum at Bloc, occassionaly it is required to complete essay-style assignments on a given topic.
            These assignments often require research and further reading to fully grasp the topic. Given the reading and effort invloved,
            it should come as no surprise that these provide a really interesting look into my learning process at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            This particular writing assignment dealt with the differences between relative and absolute positioning in CSS.
            The reason why I am featuring this particular article, is becuase I found some of the nitty-gritty details about
            these two attributes much more interesting than I expected them to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relative and absolute positioning share many characteristics but differ in a major way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The default value of the position attribute is static. An element positioned with position: static; will fall into the flow the document and behave in a manner similar to how stacking physical blocks in the real world would. Statically positioned elements, however, cannot be moved with offset properties such as top right left and bottom. This is why one may want to position an element relatively using position: relative;. Elements positioned with position: relative; will still fall into the flow of the document, like stacking blocks on top of each other, but can be positioned with offset attributes.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is in distinct contrast to positioning an element absolutely with position: absolute;. An element positioned with position: absolute; will be removed from the flow of the document. This means that it does not affect nor is affected by other elements on the page. In fact, if you were to have three elements positioned statically or relatively to each other and set the middle element to have a position of absolute, the third and bottom item would slide up and cover the second item. In this instance, the third item is no longer aware of the second item because it has been removed from the flow of the document. See the following examples.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>EXAMPLE 1:</strong>
            <script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/sz53tdj3/embed/css/"></script>
          </p>
          <p>
            The above CSS would style three boxes that are placed relatively to one another. You can imagine that these boxes are like blocks in the real world. They stack nicely in a row because they are in the flow of the document. notice that box2 is offset from the left by 100px. This is because position: relative; allows for offset positioning. The result below illustrates the output of this example.
          </p>
          <p>
            <script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/sz53tdj3/embed/result/"></script>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>EXAMPLE 2:</strong>
            <script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/gq8wrwqh/embed/css/"></script>
          </p>
          <p>
            In this example, we take the same three boxes but change the value of box2's position attribute to absolute. This takes box2 out of the flow of the document. Just as in the word example above, box3 shifts up and covers box2 because it is as if box2 does not exist in the document. The result below illustrates the output of this example. It is important to note that absolutely positioned elements are placed relative to their first non-statically-positioned ancestor (i.e. this example).
          </p>
          <p>
            <script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/gq8wrwqh/embed/result/"></script>
          </p>

            When you work through HTML and CSS, it can be really helpful to practice your understanding of concepts and put them down
            in code. This can help solidify your understanding of the topics being covered, or shed light on things you might need
            to look a little deeper into.
