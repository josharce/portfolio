          <h3>Looking back at jQuery vs Vanilla Javascript DOM Scripting</h3>
          <p>
            As part of the curriculum at Bloc, occassionaly it is required to complete essay-style assignments on a given topic.
            These assignments often require research and further reading to fully grasp the topic. Given the reading and effort invloved,
            it should come as no surprise that these provide a really interesting look into my learning process at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            This particular writing assignment posed a question easily found across forums on the internet:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              "If jQuery's so great, then why would anyone ever use boring, stupid, old DOM scripting?"
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
          While this question is posed in a humorous manner, it is frequently asked in various ways, especially amongst new Javascript developers. With every passing year this topic becomes more and more complex, so much so that given the ever increasing intricacies involved with the evolution of the Javascript ecosystem, one could write a book to fully address this question.
          </p>
          <p>
          While jQuery allows for the simplification of complex operations, such as dealing with Ajax, the counter argument often refers to the performance overhead and latency of using an external dependency. While there is truth to this, technological advancements, especially in the mobile space, allow for modern browsers to parse jQuery much faster than it otherwise would have; even a few years ago. This conclusion might lead many developers to believe that there is no harm in using jQuery. However, this is not the whole story. In fact, developments in modern browsers have led to the adoption of common practices that render jQuery more superfluous.
          </p>
          <p>
          It is common understanding that jQuery is important for safe cross-browser compatibility. However, the truth is, given the rate of IE8 depreciation, browsers have become increasingly easier to code for with vanilla Javascript. This leads to, what I believe to be, a deeper issue with this question.
          </p>
          <p>
          Given the relatively low learning curve of and unsurpassed usage of jQuery, the lack of knowledge of the former statement eludes to a lack of understanding of Javascript. This can lead to any number of issues. This includes inefficient usage of jQuery, such as trading performance for only a small subset of jQuery's functionality, or even using built in functionality inefficiently, like jQuery's each instead of standard for loops. But more importantly, this creates a unnecessary level of abstraction for new and junior developers. A developer getting their professional start under the bloat and protection of jQuery can lead to an inability to grow into other frameworks and ecosystems, especially considering Javascript is no longer just client-side language. The advancements of HTML5 and ECMAscript have significantly lowered the bar of entry for vanilla development, and un-cautioned use of jQuery may be unnecessarily and detrimentally used in some cases.

          <h3>THE TAKE AWAY</h3>
          <p>
            Javascript becomes more powerful with each passing iteration. While jQuery can be an invaluable tool for DOM
            manipulation, it should be treated as just that - <em>a tool</em>. It may be worthwhile to avoid any abstraction of
            the underlying application logic if it does not offer any notable advantages!
