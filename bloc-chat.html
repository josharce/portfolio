          <h3>WHAT IS IT?</h3>
          <p>
            This project was a part of the curriculum at Bloc in front-end web development.
            Bloc Chat is an application built with AngularJS on the front-end, and Firebase for real-time data management. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Parts of the main design, especially the chat box and room list were modeled with the Slack desktop application as a
            inspiration.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h3>UNDER THE HOOD AND NOTABLE</h3>
          <img src="assets/images/blocchat/username.png" class="img-fluid">
          <p>
            When the application page is loaded, ng-cookie service is invoked to check whether or not the requesting user has a cookie stored
            with the appropriate value corresponding to the username used in the chat rooms. If one is not found, the user is prompted to 
            create one with a modal. This modal cannot be closed by the user and the background of the application becomes static - this
            is another way to prevent the user from accessing the application without a username.
          </p>
          <br />
          <img src="assets/images/blocchat/roomcreate.png" class="img-fluid">
          <p>
            After entering a username, or returning from a previous visit, the user can either enter an already available room or create
            one by clicking the Create New Room button at the bottom of the room list pane. When this button is clicked, the user is
            presented with another modal that allows the entering of a room name and clicking ok or canceling the operation altogether
            by clicking cancel. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As seen in the figure above, the user cannot create a room that already exists. The application queries the list of rooms
            from the Firebase database and if the entered name exists, the submit function is not called and an error message is displayed.
            Because the list available rooms is queried from Firebase directly, it is updated in real-time and any added room name is immediately 
            available to check against.

          <h3>SIMPLY ANGULAR</h3>
          <img src="assets/images/blocchat/main.png" class="img-fluid">
          <p>
            AngularJS expressions allow for easy updating of UI components. In the figure above, notice that the active room name
            appears three times. The first one is in the Rooms pane on the right. The second is the active room title at the top of the
            chat window, and the third is in the bottom of the Bloc Chat window in the create message text area.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the user clicks on a room listed in the Rooms pane, the selected room is stored in an accessible variable, while
            querying the message corresponding associated to the room. The chat window and compose message box uses an AngularJS 
            expression to dynamically update with the proper room name. Using an expression is effective because it allows for real time
            data binding that changes based on the where the user is focused.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is worth noting that when there is no active room, the compose message box does not appear, and the chat window displays
            a centered message prompting the user to either click on a room to get started chatting or to create a new room.

          <h3>THE TAKE AWAY</h3>
          <p>
            While other projects have demonstrated the power of AngularJS, creating Bloc Chat illustrated how the AngularFIre library
            makes integrating Firebase into Angular projects an absolute treat.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was important to follow the Firebase documentation, as it outlines the best practices for structuring the data
            in your application. It was very eye opening working with a non-relational database. The data is loosely structured, yet
            specific querying allows for very minimal data transfer, only downloading exactly what is needed to fulfill the users' request.
