          <h3>WHAT IS IT?</h3>
          <p>
            This project was a part of the curriculum at Bloc in front-end web development.
            Bloc Jams was built twice to experiment with technology usability and to facilitate the understanding of front-end web technologies. The first iteration of this project was built solely using HTML and CSS for the layout and responsiveness, with
            Javascript and jQuery implementing user-interactivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second version was built using AngularJS in contrast. The views that are loaded are still built with HTML and CSS for 
            layout and responsiveness, but user interactive and dynamic information are handled using Javascript and Angular directives.
          </p>

          <h3>UNDER THE HOOD AND NOTABLE</h3>
          <img src="assets/images/blocjams/collection.png" class="img-fluid">
          <p>
            When the collection page is loaded, the view is populated with albums available to listen to. For the sake of this project,
            the album information is stored inside a static fixtures file. The information contained within this file is JSON data. As 
            seen in the demo, the first version of this project requests the first item in the JSON object and repeats the information 
            by appending an album "template" using a for loop. The AngularJS version of Bloc Jams works similarly, however, the template 
            is repeated using the ng-repeat directive.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is worth noting, that this system of displaying the albums in the collection view could be modified to query a server side
            database of albums as well. Using the same for-loop or ng-repeat directive implemented in this example, the new album data can 
            be used instead seamlessly.
          </p>
          <br />
          <img src="assets/images/blocjams/album.png" class="img-fluid">
          <p>
            The individual album view utilizes a similar method in the track listing. The individual song names and associated information
            reside in the album JSON object as well. When the page is loaded, the template for the individual songs are loaded using a for-loop
            that iterates based on the number of songs on the album. In similar fashion to the collection page, the AngularJS version of Bloc Jams
            uses the ng-repeat directive to display the individual tracks.

          <h3>THE ANGULAR WAY</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the development of Bloc Jams, the benefits of AngularJS became most apparent when working with the track listing
            on the individual album page. This presented itself as the most complex behavior implemented in Bloc Jams.
          </p>
          <p>
            The behavior of the individual tracks needed to be as follows:
            <ol>
              <li>When the user clicks a song to play it, the song number should change to a pause button.</li>
              <li>When the mouse leaves the table row of the currently playing song, the pause button should remain.</li>
              <li>When the user switches songs, the previously playing song's table cell should revert the content back to the song number.</li>
              <li>When the user hovers over each of the songs that aren't playing, the play button should still appear; however, the application shouldn't show the play button when the user hovers over the playing song.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            The code below illustrates how this is accomplished in the first version of Bloc Jams. Please note that for the sake
            of brevity, the event listener that binds the click handler to the mouse events has been omitted. This includes the events
            mouseover, mouseleave and click.
          </p>
          <p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/josharce/8623af6aea70db615397b3507fbe98af.js"></script>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The AngularJS implementation is starkly different. The logic of the user interactivity can be controlled almost entirely using
            built-in Angular directives. Furthermore, by using directives, the resulting code that implements this logic is mostly
            written using HTML. The following code snippet illustrates this:
          </p>
          <p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/josharce/4003811c9850b49e6971d6c4df0aa604.js"></script>
          </p>
          <p>
            While the variable 'playing' resides in the corresponding controller, every other bit of logic is built right into this table. 
            AngularJS' built-in directives ng-mouseover and ng-mouseleave allow the logic for events, with variable value manipulation,
            to be built directly into the HTML.

          <h3>THE TAKE AWAY</h3>
          <p>
            I began this project with assumptions that proved ill-got or misguided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having used jQuery to varying small degrees, I thought using it would result in the easiest implementations of the 
            features I needed. I grossly underestimated the power of AngularJS. As I began to utilize more of the framework's 
            built-in functionality, I was shocked at the ease of functionality implementation. AngularJS proved to be every bit as 
            powerful as I have understood it to be, and it made refactoring Bloc Jams an exciting undertaking in learning a new 
            web technology.
